# Flask - PortfolioApp
  Concept of using a Flask web application to present my resume and information about me to the users of the web application.
  
## Technologies Used:
  - Python
  - Flask
  - SQLite
  - Bootstrap
  
## Description:
  The web application is built to connect and query my employment, contact, and resumse information from an SQLite3 database and present it to the users/viewers on multiple pages. This application does not possess all of the CRUD operations currently, as this is just a concept and I am working on this, I will be introducing an admin section where I will be able to login to add, edit/update, or delete any of the information that is stored in the applications database.
